Developing WebService Client from Correios API
----------------------------------------------

1) We need to generate the client stubs, so open your command line, and enter the wsimport command:

wsimport -s temp http://ws.correios.com.br/calculador/CalcPrecoPrazo.asmx?WSDL

Remember to create directory temp first. Them copy the files generated to your desired location (mine is com.jogano10.client)
Be carefull when you change the packages. Both web services and JAXB (XML parser) need the correct packages
